 Which state has more fatal collisions due to unlawful driving: Colorado or Washington?\
I hypothesize that Colorado will have more fatal collisions resulting from unlawful driving.\
To answer this question, I am using publically available data from 2012. For the purpose of this analysis, unlawful driving will include fatalities due to speeding or alcohol impairment. 
Variables included: \
Percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were alcohol-impaired, meaning out of all the fatal collisions that were reported in this study, the percentage that included alcohol impairment. 
Percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were speeding, meaning out of all the fatal collisions that were reported in this study, the percentage that included speeding.
